Multi-class text classification using deep learning in Pytorch

This repository contains the implmentation of multi-class text classification using LSTM model in PyTorch deep learning framework. 

Text Classification is one of the basic and most important task of Natural Language Processing. In this repository, I am focussing on one such multi-class text classification task and that is Question Classification (I took bioasq dataset of questions and 4 categories as an example.).

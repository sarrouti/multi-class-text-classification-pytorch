## Description
Multi-class text classification using deep learning in Pytorch

This repository contains the implmentation of multi-class text classification using LSTM model in PyTorch deep learning framework. 

Text Classification is one of the basic and most important task of Natural Language Processing. In this repository, I am focussing on one such multi-class text classification task and that is Question Classification (I took bioasq dataset of questions and 4 categories as an example.). 

## Requirements
  * Python==3.6.9
  * PyTorch==0.4.0
  * torchtext==0.2.3

## Downloads and Setup
Once you clone this repo, run the vocab.py, store_dataset.py, train.py and evaluate.py file to process the dataset, to train and evaluate the model.
```shell
$ python vocab.py
$ python store_dataset.py
$ python train.py
$ python evaluate.py
```
